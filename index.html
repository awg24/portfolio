			<h5 class="underline">About me</h5>
			<p>
				I went through a 3-month full-time coding bootcamp called The Iron Yard back in May 2015 where I learned primarily front-end development. Since then, I've picked up a few remote jobs/contracts where I really honed my skills as a developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the course of my most recent job, I found that I get a real kick out of making APIs. For whatever reason, I have a lot of fun using Postman to hit endpoints I've made and seeing the response pop up (or a 500 error that I have to debug). Aside from APIs, I really like building out new tools, or features, for clients. There's just something that's extremely gratifying about turning a thought, or in most cases a need, and making it into a reality.

				<p>
					A cms tool for an Internet of Things (IoT) device. I'm still under an NDA so I can't go into too much detail about it. However, I can say it used Angular on the front-end and used Parse for an easy backend.
				</p>
				<p>
					An Admin interface for another IoT device (still NDA'd). It was a SailsJs project which used Angular for the front-end. With this project, I transitioned more into a full-stack role as I had to create/debug some sails routes. Waterline was used for the ORM. Deployed to AWS, gained experience using s3 and the aws-sdk for NodeJS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Helped build out an interactive game for students for the upcoming election. Details about the game can be found here:
					<a href="https://www.fanschool.org/election-challenge">https://www.fanschool.org/election-challenge</a>
					This project used React + Redux on the front-end, which I built out, inside a Rails environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					For each of these projects, I was working remote and corresponded daily with my PMs to figure out what more needed to be done and improvements that needed to be made.
